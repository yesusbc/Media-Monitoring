                              [fail_dmcommands], [card_uri])

   Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as Tweeting.

   For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the authenticating
   user's recent Tweets. Any attempt that would result in duplication will be
   blocked, resulting in a 403 error. A user cannot submit the same status
   twice in a row.

   While not rate limited by the API, a user is limited in the number of Tweets
   they can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the user
   reaches the current allowed limit this method will return an HTTP 403 error.

   :param status: The text of your status update.
   :param in_reply_to_status_id: The ID of an existing status that the update
      is in reply to. Note: This parameter will be ignored unless the author of
      the Tweet this parameter references is mentioned within the status text.
      Therefore, you must include @username, where username is the author of
      the referenced Tweet, within the update.
   :param auto_populate_reply_metadata: If set to true and used with
      in_reply_to_status_id, leading @mentions will be looked up from the
      original Tweet, and added to the new Tweet from there. This wil append
      @mentions into the metadata of an extended Tweet as a reply chain grows,
      until the limit on @mentions is reached. In cases where the original
      Tweet has been deleted, the reply will fail.
   :param exclude_reply_user_ids: When used with auto_populate_reply_metadata,
      a comma-separated list of user ids which will be removed from the
      server-generated @mentions prefix on an extended Tweet. Note that the
      leading @mention cannot be removed as it would break the
      in-reply-to-status-id semantics. Attempting to remove it will be
      silently ignored.
   :param attachment_url: In order for a URL to not be counted in the status
      body of an extended Tweet, provide a URL as a Tweet attachment. This URL
      must be a Tweet permalink, or Direct Message deep link. Arbitrary,
      non-Twitter URLs must remain in the status text. URLs passed to the
      attachment_url parameter not matching either a Tweet permalink or Direct
      Message deep link will fail at Tweet creation and cause an exception.
   :param media_ids: A list of media_ids to associate with the Tweet.
      You may include up to 4 photos or 1 animated GIF or 1 video in a Tweet.
   :param possibly_sensitive: If you upload Tweet media that might be
      considered sensitive content such as nudity, or medical procedures, you
      must set this value to true.
   :param lat: The latitude of the location this Tweet refers to. This
      parameter will be ignored unless it is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0
      (North is positive) inclusive. It will also be ignored if there is no
      corresponding long parameter.
   :param long: The longitude of the location this Tweet refers to. The valid
      ranges for longitude are -180.0 to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive.
      This parameter will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a
      number, if geo_enabled is disabled, or if there no corresponding lat
      parameter.
   :param place_id: A place in the world.
   :param display_coordinates: Whether or not to put a pin on the exact
      coordinates a Tweet has been sent from.
   :param trim_user: |trim_user|
   :param enable_dmcommands: When set to true, enables shortcode commands for
      sending Direct Messages as part of the status text to send a Direct
      Message to a user. When set to false, disables this behavior and includes
      any leading characters in the status text that is posted
   :param fail_dmcommands: When set to true, causes any status text that starts
      with shortcode commands to return an API error. When set to false, allows
      shortcode commands to be sent in the status text and acted on by the API.
   :param card_uri: Associate an ads card with the Tweet using the card_uri
      value from any ads card response.
   :rtype: :class:`Status` object


.. method:: API.update_with_media(filename, [status], \
                                  [in_reply_to_status_id], \
                                  [auto_populate_reply_metadata], [lat], \
                                  [long], [source], [place_id], [file])

   *Deprecated*: Use :func:`API.media_upload` instead. Update the authenticated
   user's status. Statuses that are duplicates or too long will be silently
   ignored.

   :param filename: The filename of the image to upload. This will
                    automatically be opened unless `file` is specified
   :param status: The text of your status update.
   :param in_reply_to_status_id: The ID of an existing status that the update
                                 is in reply to.
   :param auto_populate_reply_metadata: Whether to automatically include the
                                        @mentions in the status metadata.
   :param lat: The location's latitude that this tweet refers to.
   :param long: The location's longitude that this tweet refers to.
   :param source: Source of the update. Only supported by Identi.ca. Twitter

   :param place_id: Twitter ID of location which is listed in the Tweet if
                    geolocation is enabled for the user.
   :param file: A file object, which will be used instead of opening
                `filename`. `filename` is still required, for MIME type
                detection and to use as a form field in the POST data

Help Methods
------------

.. method:: API.search(q, [geocode], [lang], [locale], [result_type], \
                       [count], [until], [since_id], [max_id], \
                       [include_entities])

   Returns a collection of relevant Tweets matching a specified query.
   
   Please note that Twitter's search service and, by extension, the Search API
   is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets. Not all Tweets will be
   indexed or made available via the search interface.

   In API v1.1, the response format of the Search API has been improved to
   return Tweet objects more similar to the objects you’ll find across the REST
   API and platform. However, perspectival attributes (fields that pertain to
   the perspective of the authenticating user) are not currently supported on
   this endpoint.\ [#]_\ [#]_

   :param q: the search query string of 500 characters maximum, including
      operators. Queries may additionally be limited by complexity.
   :param geocode: Returns tweets by users located within a given radius of the
      given latitude/longitude.  The location is preferentially taking from the
      Geotagging API, but will fall back to their Twitter profile. The
      parameter value is specified by "latitide,longitude,radius", where radius
      units must be specified as either "mi" (miles) or "km" (kilometers). Note
      that you cannot use the near operator via the API to geocode arbitrary
      locations; however you can use this geocode parameter to search near
      geocodes directly. A maximum of 1,000 distinct "sub-regions" will be
      considered when using the radius modifier.
   :param lang: Restricts tweets to the given language, given by an ISO 639-1
      code. Language detection is best-effort.
   :param locale: Specify the language of the query you are sending (only ja is
      currently effective). This is intended for language-specific consumers
      and the default should work in the majority of cases.
   :param result_type: Specifies what type of search results you would prefer
      to receive. The current default is "mixed." Valid values include:

      * mixed : include both popular and real time results in the response
      * recent : return only the most recent results in the response
      * popular : return only the most popular results in the response
   :param count: |count|
   :param until: Returns tweets created before the given date. Date should be
      formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind that the search index has a 7-day
      limit. In other words, no tweets will be found for a date older than one
      week.
   :param since_id: |since_id| There are limits to the number of Tweets which
      can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occurred
      since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID
      available.
   :param max_id: |max_id|
   :param include_entities: |include_entities|
   :rtype: :class:`SearchResults` object


List Methods
------------

.. method:: API.create_list(name, [mode], [description])

   Note that you can create up to 1000 lists per account.

   :param name: The name of the new list.
   :param mode: |list_mode|
   :param description: The description of the list you are creating.
   :rtype: :class:`List` object


.. method:: API.destroy_list([owner_screen_name/owner_id], list_id/slug)

   Deletes the specified list.
   The authenticated user must own the list to be able to destroy it.

   :param owner_screen_name: |owner_screen_name|
   :param owner_id: |owner_id|
   :param list_id: |list_id|
   :param slug: |slug|
   :rtype: :class:`List` object


.. method:: API.update_list(list_id/slug, [name], [mode], [description], \
                            [owner_screen_name/owner_id])

   The authenticated user must own the list to be able to update it.

   :param list_id: |list_id|
   :param slug: |slug|
   :param name: The name for the list.
   :param mode: |list_mode|
   :param description: The description to give the list.

   :param owner_id: |owner_id|
   :rtype: :class:`List` object


.. method:: API.lists_all([screen_name], [user_id], [reverse])

   Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes to,
   including their own. The user is specified using the ``user_id`` or
   ``screen_name`` parameters. If no user is given, the authenticating user is
   used.

   A maximum of 100 results will be returned by this call. Subscribed lists are
   returned first, followed by owned lists. This means that if a user
   subscribes to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns 90
   subscriptions and 10 owned lists. The ``reverse`` method returns owned lists
   first, so with ``reverse=true``, 20 owned lists and 80 subscriptions would
   be returned.

   :param screen_name: |screen_name|
   :param user_id: |user_id|
   :param reverse: A boolean indicating if you would like owned lists to be
                   returned first. See description above for information on how
                   this parameter works.

Trends Methods
--------------

.. method:: API.trends_available()

   Returns the locations that Twitter has trending topic information for.
   The response is an array of "locations" that encode the location's WOEID
   (a Yahoo! Where On Earth ID) and some other human-readable information such
   as a canonical name and country the location belongs in.

   :rtype: :class:`JSON` object


.. method:: API.trends_place(id, [exclude])

   Returns the top 50 trending topics for a specific WOEID,
   if trending information is available for it.

   The response is an array of “trend” objects that encode the name of the
   trending topic, the query parameter that can be used to search for the topic
   on Twitter Search, and the Twitter Search URL.

   This information is cached for 5 minutes. Requesting more frequently than
   that will not return any more data, and will count against your rate limit
   usage.

   The tweet_volume for the last 24 hours is also returned for many trends if
   this is available.

   :param id: The Yahoo! Where On Earth ID of the location to return trending
              information for. Global information is available by using 1 as
              the WOEID.
   :param exclude: Setting this equal to hashtags will remove all hashtags
                   from the trends list.

   closest to a specified location.

   The response is an array of “locations” that encode the location’s WOEID and
   some other human-readable information such as a canonical name and country
   the location belongs in.

   A WOEID is a Yahoo! Where On Earth ID.

   :param lat: If provided with a long parameter the available trend locations
               will be sorted by distance, nearest to furthest, to the
               co-ordinate pair. The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0 to
               +180.0 (West is negative, East is positive) inclusive.
   :param long: If provided with a lat parameter the available trend locations
                will be sorted by distance, nearest to furthest, to the
                co-ordinate pair. The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0 to
                +180.0 (West is negative, East is positive) inclusive.
   :rtype: :class:`JSON` object


Geo Methods
-----------

.. method:: API.reverse_geocode([lat], [long], [accuracy], [granularity], \
                                [max_results])

   Given a latitude and longitude, looks for places (cities and neighbourhoods)
   whose IDs can be specified in a call to :func:`update_status` to appear as
   the name of the location. This call provides a detailed response about the
   location in question; the :func:`nearby_places` function should be preferred
   for getting a list of places nearby without great detail.

   :param lat: The location's latitude.
   :param long: The location's longitude.
   :param accuracy: Specify the "region" in which to search, such as a number
                    (then this is a radius in meters, but it can also take a
                    string that is suffixed with ft to specify feet).
                    If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m
   :param granularity: Assumed to be `neighborhood' by default; can also be
                       `city'.
   :param max_results: A hint as to the maximum number of results to return.
                       This is only a guideline, which may not be adhered to.


.. method:: API.reverse_geocode([lat], [long], [ip], [accuracy], \
                                [granularity], [max_results])

   Given a latitude and longitude, looks for nearby places (cities and
   neighbourhoods) whose IDs can be specified in a call to
   :func:`update_status` to appear as the name of the location. This call
   provides a detailed response about the location in question; the
   :func:`nearby_places` function should be preferred for getting a list of
   places nearby without great detail.

   :param lat: The location's latitude.
   :param long: The location's longitude.
   :param ip: The location's IP address. Twitter will attempt to geolocate
              using the IP address.
   :param accuracy: Specify the "region" in which to search, such as a number
                    (then this is a radius in meters, but it can also take a
                    string that is suffixed with ft to specify feet).
                    If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m
   :param granularity: Assumed to be `neighborhood' by default; can also be
                       `city'.
   :param max_results: A hint as to the maximum number of results to return.
                       This is only a guideline, which may not be adhered to.


.. method:: API.geo_id(id)

   Given *id* of a place, provide more details about that place.

   :param id: Valid Twitter ID of a location.


Utility methods
---------------

.. method:: API.configuration()

   Returns the current configuration used by Twitter including twitter.com
   slugs which are not usernames, maximum photo resolutions, and t.co
   shortened URL length. It is recommended applications request this endpoint
   when they are loaded, but no more than once a day.


Media methods
-------------

.. method:: API.media_upload(filename, [file])

   Use this endpoint to upload images to Twitter.

   :param filename: The filename of the image to upload. This will
                    automatically be opened unless ``file`` is specified.
   :param file: A file object, which will be used instead of opening
                ``filename``. ``filename`` is still required, for MIME type
                detection and to use as a form field in the POST data.
   :rtype: :class:`Media` object


.. method:: API.create_media_metadata(media_id, alt_text)

   This endpoint can be used to provide additional information about the
   uploaded media_id. This feature is currently only supported for images and
   GIFs. Call this endpoint to attach additional metadata such as image alt
   text.
   
   :param media_id: The ID of the media to add alt text to.
   :param alt_text: The alt text to add to the image.


:mod:`tweepy.error` --- Exceptions
==================================

The exceptions are available in the ``tweepy`` module directly, which means
``tweepy.error`` itself does not need to be imported. For example,
``tweepy.error.TweepError`` is available as ``tweepy.TweepError``.


.. exception:: TweepError

   The main exception Tweepy uses. Is raised for a number of things.

   When a ``TweepError`` is raised due to an error Twitter responded with,
   the error code (`as described in the API documentation
   <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/response-codes>`_) can be
   accessed at ``TweepError.response.text``. Note, however, that
   ``TweepError``\ s also may be raised with other things as message
   (for example plain error reason strings).


.. exception:: RateLimitError

   Is raised when an API method fails due to hitting Twitter's rate limit.
   Makes for easy handling of the rate limit specifically.

   Inherits from :exc:`TweepError`, so ``except TweepError`` will catch a
   ``RateLimitError`` too.
